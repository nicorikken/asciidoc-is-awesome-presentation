== Markup languages and me
. HTML
. Wiki
. Org mode
. Markdown
. LaTeX
. Asciidoc

== What makes a good markup language?
* Extensibility
* Multiple output forms (article, book, presentation)
* Convenient source-code
** Easy to understand
** Easy to edit

*For the joy and effectiveness of the user*

== Why use a markup language?
* DRY principle: reuse your words and structure
* Use your favorite editor
* Use revision control
* Integrate with other projects (pre and post processing)

== My successful markup day in Org mode
=== Scenario
_Having limited time at an external customer for developing a project plan_

=== Timeline
. Discuss and take notes in Org mode
. Restructure notes into a plan
. Improve in discussion via an article view
. Present to the board in presentation mode
. Hand over the presentation and report

=== Conclusion
_One source, no repetition, little styling fuzz_

== What is Asciidoc?

_A publisher-grade markup language_

[quote, O'reilly Media, Atlas documentation]
AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing (among other things) books, ebooks, and documentation. It’s similar to wiki markup—if you can write a Wikipedia article, then you’ll have no problem with AsciiDoc. The main advantages of AsciiDoc are that it is easy to use and plays well with O’Reilly’s publishing tools, including Atlas.

= Asciidoc is awesome
:Author: Nico Rikken

*bold* _italic_

.List title
* Unorderedlist
.. Ordered list

[source, shell]
----
echo "hello world"
----

.Image caption
image::icon.png[]
-----

== Powerful features

=== Rendering conditions
Using attributes in the rendering to define the output

[source, asciidoc]
-----
ifdef ::beta[]
This text is only included in the beta-version of the documentation.
endif ::beta[]
-----

_This can also be an easy way out for dealing with differences between output types_

=== Internal referencing
Naming elements in the source and referencing them

=== Bibliography
Bibliographic features out of the box

[source, asciidoc]
----
[bibliography]
.Optional list title
- [[[taoup]]] Eric Steven Raymond. 'The Art of UNIX
  Programming'. Addison-Wesley. ISBN 0-13-142901-9.
----

=== Built-in styles
* Lists
* Source code
* Quotes
* Tables
* Admonition blocks
* And more...

[TIP]
====
Admonition blocks can be used for explicitly highlighting information, without interrupting the flow of the text. Also it allows for easier scanning by the reader. These blocks can often be found in books.

== Asciidoc in practice

=== Toolchain
[graphviz, asciidoc-pipeline, png]
----
digraph G {
  "asciidoc source" -> "asciidoctor-diagram"
  "asciidoctor-diagram" -> asciidoctor
  templates -> asciidoctor
  asciidoctor -> output
  output -> pandoc
  pandoc -> docx
}
----

=== Because rendered images are awesome too

[graphviz, asciidoc-pipeline, png]
----
digraph G {
  "asciidoc source" -> "asciidoctor-diagram"
  "asciidoctor-diagram" -> asciidoctor
  templates -> asciidoctor
  asciidoctor -> output
  output -> pandoc
  pandoc -> docx
}

=== Like PlantUML component diagrams

.PlantUML component diagram
[plantuml, plantuml-component-demo, png]
----
@startuml

DataAccess - [First Component] 
[First Component] ..> HTTP : use

=== Like PlantUML sequence diagrams

.PlantUML sequence diagram
[plantuml, plantuml-sequence-demo, png]
----
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml

=== Like PlantUML Salt UI wire diagrams

.Salt UI wire-diagrams
[plantuml, plantuml-salt-demo, png]
----
@startuml
salt
{
  Just plain text
  [This is my button]
  ()  Unchecked radio
  (X) Checked radio
  []  Unchecked box
  [X] Checked box
  "Enter text here   "
  ^This is a droplist^
}
